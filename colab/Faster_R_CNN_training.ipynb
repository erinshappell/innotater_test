        "This notebook will allow you to train a custom object detector using Google's GPU resources. Enable this by going to Runtime -> Change runtime type and select \"GPU\" from the dropdown menu. This will speed your training time up substantially, but note that Google has a limit on how much of this GPU resource you can use. If you use the GPU resource heavily, you may have to subscribe to a paid plan. In this notebook, we will be fine-tuning the Faster-RCNN network (specifically, the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2) starting from a model pre-trained on the COCO 2017 image set. This pre-trained model is provided in the Tensorflow 2 Model Zoo [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md). \n",

If you open the label_map.pbtxt file (which you can do from the sidebar of this notebook once your google drive is connected - click the file icon -> drive -> MyDrive -> wherever this file is ->training ->label_map.pbtxt), you will see that each class has a corresponding id.
